Laverna is a JavaScript note-taking web application with a Markdown editor and encryption support.  It's built to be an open source alternative to Evernote.

The application stores all your notes in your browser databases such as indexedDB or localStorage, which is good for security reasons, because only you have access to them.

**Demo**: https://laverna.cc/ OR http://laverna.github.io/static-laverna

## Features
-----------

* Markdown editor based on Pagedown
* Manage your notes, even when you're offline
* Secure client-side encryption
* Synchronizes with cloud storage services (currently only with Dropbox and RemoteStorage)
* Three editing modes: distraction free, preview, and normal mode
* WYSIWYG control buttons
* MathJax support
* Syntax highlighting
* No registration required
* Web based
* Keybindings

## Installation
---------------
There are several ways to start using Laverna:

4. Build it from the source code.
